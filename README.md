Museum Passport
=====================

A project to create a mobile app that engages children whilst visiting London museums.

### Background

Long-standing exhibitions in London museums are often not
as engaging as they could be for young people, and don't always make use of technology to improve this.

We wanted to create a mobile app that encouraged children to answer questions, take photos and play games based on the exhibitions they visited, all of which could be recorded in their 'passport'.

### Front-end

Technologies used:
* JavaScript
* Ionic
* HTML
* CSS / Sass

### Back-end

The backend API was deployed separately and uses Ruby on Rails, and is used to manage user accounts, museum and exhibitions information, questions, and game words.
